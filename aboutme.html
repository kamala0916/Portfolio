  <p> Today I have learned how to draw shapes using python. It was harder than using Scratch. The concept of both languages is pretty much the same. Python is harder because you have to actually write out the code instead of just looking for blocks to build up the code. Also, one of the difficulties that I have faced was when I was trying to draw a certain shape I had to imagine the movements of the turtle in my head becasuse python doesn't display the the turtle simultaneously as you write the code.</p>
