  </p> It makes me exited that computer science plays a huge role in robotics. It also makes me nervous because things like selfdriving cars will cause unemployment. Working in groups is the best idea, even though I always liked working independently. My gorupmates always help me whenever I struggle which I enjoy a lot.   </p>
