I moved to New York when I was 12. What I like about photography is that when you take a picture of something is like capturing a memory. I like to take pictures of architecture. Specifically, buildings with a unique design. I travel to the city a lot and I always look for a nice or a unique view. In Baku there are several different beautiful buildings that I didn't get to take pictures of yet. I am a very positive person so I like to make my subject stand out by making it more bright or colorful.";
